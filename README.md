## fish-phpartisan

[//fishshell.com/](Fish shell) completion for artisan commands, even one you made yourself

### "Dirty" completions for php artisan commands.

And by dirty i mean, made just for fun, with no deep thought put in to it

- creates alias `phpartisan` for `php artisan` (rename to `pa` ?)
- parses `php arisan list` when completion called

### Install with [fisherman](//fisherman.sh/)
```
fisher gcoda/fish-phpartisan
```

Poke me if you got any ideas
